## Objective 

The objective of this project is to provide a detailed and insightful analysis of a superstore dataset to support data-driven decision-making processes. By leveraging advanced data visualization techniques and applying seven key filters—category, sub-category, segment, region, ship mode, state, and year—this analysis aims to uncover critical business insights that can guide strategic planning, enhance sales strategies, and optimize overall store performance.

## Scope

This project will analyze key metrics, sales trends, and profitability across multiple dimensions (city, category, segment, state, and shipping mode) in the superstore dataset. It will identify top-performing products, detect seasonal sales patterns, and uncover opportunities for targeted promotions and cross-selling strategies.
